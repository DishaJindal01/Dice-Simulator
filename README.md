# Dice-Simulator
This project is a dice simulator that allows users to roll different colored diceâ€”red, blue, or green. Each die has its own probability distribution for rolling numbers, with the red die being biased towards rolling a 6 more often. Users can continuously roll the dice until they choose to quit. It's a fun way to explore probabilities and randomness.
